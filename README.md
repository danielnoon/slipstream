# [Slipstream](https://slipstreamapp.net)
An advanced Mario Kart tournament bracket/leaderboard generator.

## The Problem
Ever wanted to run a Mario Kart tournament but didn't know where to start? As a tournament organizer (TO), there's *tons* of headaches that will need to be navigated:
* What do you do if you have a number of players not evenly divisible by 4?
* How do you seed everyone to ensure the races are fair?
* How can you give everyone an equal shot at winning?
* What will the course selection be for each round?
* Mario Kart titles have a pretty bad multiplayer points spread, which allows the racer in first to gain a huge lead. Could there be a more fair points distribution model to keep everyone close together?

Slipstream's ultimate goal is to solve these issues and make it as easy and headache-free as possible to set up a Mario Kart tournament of any size. 

Whether you want to host a small one with a few of your friends, a mid-sized event with your residence hall floor, or a large tournament with the entire residence hall, Slipstream has you covered.

## The Premise
As fans of the Mario Kart series, and even bigger fans of competitive Mario Kart events, we wanted a tournament solution that could do it all. While we understand that sites like [Challonge](https://challonge.com) exist, their solution seems to only work for one-versus-one or full round-robin bracket systems (such as Smash Bros. Tournaments). A couple of us have extensive experience running our own Mario Kart tournaments, and due to lots of racers and a lack of time, Mario Kart events often require the implementation of a [Swiss system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) (where points determine ranking in a fixed number of rounds) to ensure that the tournament is fair.  

While multiple interlinked spreadsheets (consisting of course selections, point tally algorithms, seeding data, and score entry) work decently well, we wanted a more accessible system that anyone could use.

## Disclaimer
This project is nothing more than a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). While we plan to develop this further, we would not plan a full release until we have ensured full application stability and security and other quality-of-life features.
